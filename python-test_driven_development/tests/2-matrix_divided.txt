"""
This test file contains doctest cases for the matrix_divided function.
"""
This function divides all elements of a matrix by a divisor and 
rounds the result to 2 decimal places.

>>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 3)

>>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 1)
[[1.0, 2.0, 3.0], [4.0, 5.0, 6.0]]

>>> matrix = [[1.5, 2.5, 3.5], [4.5, 5.5, 6.5]]
>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 0.5)
